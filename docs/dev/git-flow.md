# Git Flow
This document outlines the strategies and workflows used by the project to progress.

## Introduction
As the name of this document implies, Horizon uses Git Flow workflow as it was first described by Vincent Driessen in their blog post [A successful Git  branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

### Modified Naming Convention
Other than defined in the blog post, we use the following naming convention for branches:

- Feature Branch: `feat/*`
- Fix Branch: `fix/*`
- Release Branch: `release/*`
