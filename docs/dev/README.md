# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the developer documentation of Horizon.

While extensive documentation is never a bad thing, the main goal of these docs, is to document general principles, broader concepts, and quicks that may not easily be understood by people new to this project.  
With that being said, documentation is always good, so there is no limit in what can be documented here as long as the quality is up to standards.
