# Documentation
Welcome to the official documentation of Horizon. This is where you find, both, developer and user documentation.

As such, this directory is separated into two subdirectories:
- `dev`
- `usr`

## [`dev/`](./dev/)
This is where developer documentation is stored. It is only relevant for people actively developing Horizon or wishing to contribute to the project.

## [`usr/`](./usr/)
This is where user documentation is stored. It is relevant for people using Horizon. Things like configuration options, usage recommendations, etc. can be found here.
